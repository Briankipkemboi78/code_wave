          Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet!
          I'm Brian Kipkemboi, an aspiring software engineer on a mission to explore the limitless possibilities of technology.
          With a background in data analysis and a burning passion for coding,
          I'm excited to share my story and aspirations with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into the world of technology started as a data analyst.
          I discovered the beauty of data-driven insights and the power of numbers
          to shape decisions. Working with data allowed me to unravel patterns,
          draw conclusions, and tell stories hidden within the numbers
        </p>
        <p>
          However, my curiosity didn't stop there.
          I found myself drawn to the world of software engineering,
          where I could bring my ideas to life through code.
          This transition from data analysis to software engineering has been a
          thrilling adventure, filled with challenges and triumphs.
